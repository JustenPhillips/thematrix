/*
A matrix is a two dimensional array. In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a 
rectangular array[1] of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and 
columns.[2][3] The dimensions of matrix (1) are 2 Ã— 3 (read "two by three"), because 
there are two rows and three columns.

A 2 by 3 matrix of integers

Matrices are very useful and represent a fundamental tool for simulating 
real-world systems.  A major branch of numerical analysis is devoted to the 
development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is 
centuries old and is today an expanding area of research.
